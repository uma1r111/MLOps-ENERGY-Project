{"question": "What is the primary way to reduce household energy bills without buying new appliances?", "ground_truth": "The most effective zero-cost methods are adjusting behaviors: turning down the thermostat by 1 degree, washing clothes at 30°C, air-drying laundry instead of using a tumble dryer, and ensuring devices are not left on standby (phantom loads)."}
{"question": "How does wind turbine technology generate electricity?", "ground_truth": "Wind turbines operate by converting the kinetic energy of wind into mechanical energy using aerodynamic blades. This mechanical energy spins a rotor connected to a main shaft, which spins a generator to produce electricity."}
{"question": "Why is the energy consumption of Machine Learning models a concern?", "ground_truth": "The energy consumption of ML models is a concern because training large models (like LLMs) requires massive computational resources (GPUs/TPUs) running for weeks, leading to a significant carbon footprint and high electricity usage, often comparable to the lifetime emissions of multiple cars."}
{"question": "What effect does temperature have on solar panel efficiency?", "ground_truth": "Contrary to intuition, solar panel efficiency decreases as temperature increases. High heat reduces the voltage output of the photovoltaic cells, making them less efficient in very hot climates compared to cooler, sunny conditions."}
{"question": "What are 'phantom loads' in the context of energy efficiency?", "ground_truth": "Phantom loads, also known as standby power or vampire power, refer to the electricity consumed by electronic appliances (like TVs, microwaves, and chargers) when they are turned off but still plugged into a power outlet."}
{"question": "How can data-driven methods help in reducing building energy consumption?", "ground_truth": "Data-driven methods utilize historical consumption data, weather forecasts, and occupancy patterns to predict energy needs. This allows Building Management Systems (BMS) to optimize heating, cooling, and lighting schedules automatically, preventing waste."}
