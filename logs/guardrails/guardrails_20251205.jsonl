For a building without roof insulation, the indoor temperature can reach 46\u00b0C without ventilation.

These systems can run whenever the outside temperature is lower than the inside temperature, even if it's necessary to extract heat to maintain the building between 21 and 25\u00b0C.

At a reasonable wind site, a typical wind turbine will produce electricity 70\u201385% of the time (Barthelmie, 2007).\n\nHere's a breakdown of how they function:\n\n1.  **Wind Capture:** Wind turbines capture power from the wind using aerodynamically designed blades, converting it into rotating mechanical power. The blades use airfoils to develop this mechanical power (Blaabjerg et al., 2004).\n2.  **Energy Conversion:** The motion of the wind is converted into rotational energy, which drives a generator.\n3.  **Electricity Generation:** The generator produces electricity. Modern wind turbines can control reactive and active power very fast, allowing the turbine to actively participate in power system control (Blaabjerg et al., 2004).\n4.  **Operating Conditions:** Wind turbines generate electricity when wind conditions are between 3 and 4 meters per second (m/s), the speed at which the turbine blades experience sufficient lift to begin rotating, and 25 to 30 m/s, depending on the manufacturer and model.\n", "toxicity_scores": {"toxicity": 0.0006559104076586664, "severe_toxicity": 0.00012277287896722555, "obscene": 0.0001905608078232035, "threat": 0.00012625576346181333, "insult": 0.0001765012857504189, "identity_attack": 0.000144889039802365}, "hallucination_detected": false, "metadata": {}, "timestamp": "2025-12-05T13:53:10.070776", "latency_ms": 589.9548530578613}}
